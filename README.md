# Archimedes

The aim of this project is to show the formalisation of the theorem of Archimedes.
This will be done by first stating and explaining the theorem.
Then the theorem will be proven and the proof will be explained.
Finally the proof will be formalised in the lean4 programming language and the process of doing this will be demonstrated.
